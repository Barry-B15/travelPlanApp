# Travel Plan App

## Introduction
This is an app to handle your travel plans. It takes 3 inputs: travel destination - city, proposed travel date, and your expected return date. It uses these information to give you the city longitude and latitude, the temperature description, the day's highest and lowest temperatures, and a picture of the city if one is available. 

## Technologies:
This app was created using the following:
* Node.js
* JavaScript
* CSS and SASS for styling
* HTML for the framework
* GeoNames.org API for the destination longitude and latitude
* Weatherbit.io API for the weather
* Pixabay API for the pictures
* webpack
* moment.js
* VSCode for writing codes


## What I did
- Modified my weather app to use webpack
- Created new folders and files then moved things around to different folders.
- Added import and export statements to some files.
- created a .babelrc file and installed babel loader.
- Registered and used 3 different APIs to get the needed information for the destination

## Prerequisite
* A computer
* A little knowledge of how to download and install technologies on a computer.

## Launch - How to run the app
### As a private server
To run this app as a private server, the user will need to make the following installations:
* Download and install node.js from: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
* open the gitbash/ powershell in the root directory.

Install the server
* $ npm install

Start the server
* $ node server.js (or simply: node server).

API key
* It is recommended that private users register free with geoname.org, weatherbit.io, and pixabay for their API keys for use in this app.

### From an online host
I am hoping to publish this on Heroku. I hope you would not have to wait for too long.

## Sources:
This project is based mostly on what was taught in the Udacity Front End Developer class
I also used a lot of help from the Mentors at Udacity who were always there to promptly direct and point to what to do at different stages.
Another great resource was stackoverflow, many of the problems I had were already discussed and answers provided by others.

## Project Status:
Almost done.
